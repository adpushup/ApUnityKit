# Ap Unity Kit - Quick Guide

## Get Started:

This guide is intended for publishers who want to monetize their Android apps/games built using Unity with AdPushup AdX ads. Integrating the Ap Unity Kit into an app is the first step toward implementing AdPushUp AdX Ads in your app.

## Implementation Steps:

### A: **Download the Ap Unity Kit plugin**:

Use the links below to download the Unity package for the plugin or to take a look at its code on GitHub.

- [View Source](https://github.com/adpushup/ApUnityKit)

### B: **Import the Ap Unity Kit plugin:**

<aside>
üí° It is advisable to add the **Google Mobile Ads Unity plugin** before adding Ap Unity Kit. Ap Unity Kit uses the **[Unity Play Services Resolver library](https://github.com/googlesamples/unity-jar-resolver)** which is distributed with the Google Mobile Ads Unity plugin.

</aside>

1. Open your project in the Unity editor. Select¬†**Assets > Import Package > Custom Package** and find the¬†`ApUnityKit.unitypackage` file you downloaded.

3. In the Unity editor, select¬†**Assets > External Dependency Manager > Android Resolver > Resolve**. The Unity External Dependency Manager library will copy the declared dependencies into the¬†`Assets/Plugins/Android` directory of your Unity app.
